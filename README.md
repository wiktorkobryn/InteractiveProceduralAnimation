# InteractiveProceduralAnimation
3D procedural animation library for various rigs on Unity 6 (sample project).
Sample models created and rigged in Blender.

**project includes:**
- *object tracker* -  for single chosen target object
- *object tracker search* - for realistic target detection (raycast area based detection mimicking security camera behaviour)
- *object tracker focus* - for handling multiple visible targets in area (tracking closest one)
- *procedural walker* - for procedural walk animation on the ground of given N-pod (where N is even - quadropod, hexapod, biped etc.)
